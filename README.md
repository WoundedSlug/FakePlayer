# FakePlayer
This is a class that can be used to create an NPC with either the skin of a player, or just using the raw data of a skin + the signature of the skin. The NPCs execute a command when right clicked which is set in the constructor. They also stare at every player at all times (Sends different look packets to each player). It runs some scoreboard checks every single tick, which is obviously inefficient, but it was made with fast production in mind, not with efficieny.
